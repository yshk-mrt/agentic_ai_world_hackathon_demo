## Inspiration
Life is full of complex decisions, from voting to major purchases. For unfamiliar topics, decision-making can be stressful. DeepDive aims to alleviate this by simulating expert discussions, providing users with deeper insights and a more enjoyable decision-making process.

## What it does
DeepDive creates a framework where multiple AI agents, guided by a moderator, engage in discussions on specific topics. Users can observe these dynamic conversations to gain comprehensive insights into their areas of interest.

## How we built it
Utilized the Fetch.AI framework to host and manage multiple agents
Implemented tool capabilities using ToolHouse.ai
Powered by Llama language model hosted on Groq
